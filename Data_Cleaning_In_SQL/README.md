# Introduction to Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project

This project showcases my SQL data cleaning skills using the Nashville Housing dataset. Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis process, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability for meaningful insights.

In this project, I performed a series of data transformation and cleaning operations to refine and standardize the dataset. Key steps include:

* **Standardizing Date Formats** â€“ Converted raw date fields into a structured format for better consistency.
* **Handling Missing Values** â€“ Populated missing Property Addresses using self-joins.
* **Breaking Down Address Fields** â€“ Split PropertyAddress and OwnerAddress into individual components (Street, City, State) for better usability.
* **Standardizing Categorical Data** â€“ Transformed 'Y' and 'N' values in Sold as Vacant into 'Yes' and 'No' for clarity.
* **Removing Duplicates** â€“ Identified and eliminated redundant records to maintain data integrity.
* **Dropping Unused Columns** â€“ Removed unnecessary fields to optimize database storage and performance.

This project demonstrates my ability to **clean**, **structure**, and **optimize datasets using SQL**, which is essential for data analysis and visualization.
